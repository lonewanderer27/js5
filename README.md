# JS5

JS5 is a comprehensive suite of numerical methods tools developed as a requirement for the Numerical Analysis subject. This project consists of four distinct applications, each designed to tackle a specific numerical analysis problem.

1. <strong>Calculog</strong> Perform calculations involving propagation error and Taylor-Maclaurin series.
2. <strong>Rootify</strong> Calculate the roots of a function using the bisection method and the Newton-Raphson method. The Secant method is also available but hidden by default.
3. <strong>Polaris</strong> Determine the crypto exchange over time using the Lagrange Method.
4. <strong>Mantarie</strong> Calculate the value of a definite integral using the Trapezoidal and Simpson's methods.

### Features
- <strong>Interactive UI</strong> Built with React and styled using Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- <strong>Math Equation Support</strong> Utilizes MathJS library to parse and evaluate user-defined mathematical functions.
- <strong>Detailed Results</strong> Generates detailed tables showing the results of each method, including intermediate steps and error analysis.
- <strong>PWA Support</strong> Configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline access and a native app-like experience.
